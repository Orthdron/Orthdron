### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

You are viewing Deepak's profile or online alias of Orthdron.


#### My professional life's TLDR

I have been developing websites and automation tools using 2011. First got into programming when I took upon myself to revamp the high school's website.
Moved onto bachelor's degree and starting working on freelancing projects on the side.
Completed degree, got a job, spent 2 years, moved to Canada to better utilize my skills.
Currently looking out for opportunities while working on several small ideas.

#### What tech can you use?

Aaah, the age old question. Well, having worked with a wide variety of languages and framework for different clients so at this point I would like to say I'm language agnostic.
